# Save Our Planet 🌍🎲

**Save Our Planet** is a Java-based educational board game focused on environmental sustainability. Designed as a console game using Eclipse, it combines strategy, knowledge, and chance to teach players about green investment, renewable energy, and the impacts of climate change.

---

## 🧠 Game Concept

Players roll virtual dice and move around a board themed with environmental fields—such as Renewable Energy, Natural Disasters, and Controversial Energy. They must:

- Invest in green tech like wind farms and solar panels
- Answer sustainability-related questions to claim or upgrade properties
- Pay tariffs when landing on opponents’ squares
- Manage limited “resource credits” strategically to avoid bankruptcy

The game ends when players either go bankrupt or voluntarily exit. The winner is the player with the most resources.
